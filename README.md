# Streamlit App for Face Detection Dataset (by Mohamed Traore)

This app allows you to upload an image of faces and use an [object detection model](https://models.roboflow.com/object-detection) to detect faces in an image, and facdes in a video feed.

The app is [found here](https://share.streamlit.io/motraor3/streamlit-bccd):

The app will work as is. If you want to build your own model, you'll need your own API key. [Create a Roboflow account](https://app.roboflow.com) to get your own API key. [Obtaining your API key](https://docs.roboflow.com/rest-api#obtaining-your-api-key)

Want to build and deploy your own object detection model and app? [Follow this link](https://blog.streamlit.io/how-to-use-roboflow-and-streamlit-to-visualize-object-detection-output/) for how to upload images for inference, and [this tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w4fgZg-jb28) shows how to add a video feed for inference.

This app was created using [Roboflow](https://roboflow.com) and [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/).
